So, I have not finished the application. However, I have made some progress.
Some of the peculiarites of some of my solutions is a result of the fact that I naturally use the 2400 hr time format and time pressure.
Currently, the app allows you to write text in a text box next to a specific time slot. However, this is not saved to local storage and so the text will disappear on page reload or some other event.
